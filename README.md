# open-1v1-game-coordinator-frontend
This is a minimal frontend application used to get the needed credentials to interact with the serverless application for Udacity's cloud developer capstone.

To run the project be sure to have installed locally NodeLTS, and then run this command inside this repo's local folder in your computer:

npm run sart
```

After loading the web application in your browser, log in with your GOOGLE account and copy the parameters prompted in the callback screen. Those parameters are needed when you run the test client: https://github.com/samuelchvez/open-1v1-coordinator-test-client
